/**
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
 * Symbol       Value
 * I             1
 * V             5
 * X             10
 * L             50
 * C             100
 * D             500
 * M             1000
 * For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply
 * X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII.
 * Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same
 * principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 * I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
 * X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
 * C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 * Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "III"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: III = 3.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "LVIII"
 * Output: 58
 * Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
 * Output: 1994
 * Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
